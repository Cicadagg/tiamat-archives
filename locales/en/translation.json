            "2": " The game was released worldwide on February 26, 2023. The events of the game take place in a dystopian, hypercapitalistic world known as 'the City', where the events of previous works by 'Project Moon' also unfold, namely: Lobotomy Corporation, Library of Ruina, webcomic Leviathan, and novel Distortion Detective. The game's action takes place some time after the events of all these stories. The game features Gacha elements, allowing players to spend real money to acquire Lunacy (in-game currency) or tickets used to acquire new Sinners' Identities or E.G.O. The in-game story is presented through a visual novel, as in the two predecessor games."
